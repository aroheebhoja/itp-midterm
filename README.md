21-321 midterm project: I came up with a variant that increases at every iteration of the Gale Shapley algorithm for stable matching, then formalized the proof. This lemma can be applied inductively to prove the existence of a total stable matching for every instance of the stable matching problem.

[This paper](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10817-024-09700-x) used a similar strategy (identifying variants and invariants, then proving things about them), but used a different variant than I did.
