21-321 midterm/final project: I came up with a variant that increases at every iteration of the Gale Shapley algorithm for stable matching, then used this to formally prove the existence of a total stable matching for every pair of finite sets of equal size equipped with total preference functions.

[This paper](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10817-024-09700-x) used a similar strategy (identifying variants and invariants, then proving things about them), but used a different variant than I did.
